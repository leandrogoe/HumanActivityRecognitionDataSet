# Introduction

In this repo we explore very simple transformations on the data that is gently supplied by the UCI in the following article:

An R scripts that does the following transformations was created:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
1. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In order to see more details about the data and how it was generated, please refer to the CodeBook markdown file.
